A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of deep learning model commonly used for analyzing visual data, particularly in tasks like image classification, object detection, and segmentation. CNNs are a specialized kind of neural network designed to work with data that has a grid-like topology, such as images.

Pre-processing training test, this is to avoid overfitting. Implement Geomatic transformations like change size, rotate etc  
This called image augmentation 
Keras Image augmentation details  - scroll down and select “Image Data Generator class”
